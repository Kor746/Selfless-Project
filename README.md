# Selfless-Project
We developed an Android mobile app that can help a person take better pictures by using websockets to continuously feed data to the backend server, where we process the data and acquire a ranking based on multiple factors (e.g., lighting) and a pre-trained deep learning model, then provide a range-based response back to the client.
